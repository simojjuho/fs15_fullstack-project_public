## Description

This project is made as a final project for Integrify Finland's Fullstack Academy (Microsoft stack) backend module. It conssts of two separate projects, frontend and backend of which backend has been programmed using C# / ASPNET Core. It's purpose is to offer a RESTFUL Api endpoint for a webshop platform. Postgres database has been made using EF Core and the frontend side has been coded with React/TypeScript. There still are many functionalities that don't function properly, but my intention is to gradually make a seamless experience.
